It is designed to help you build scalable API's faster, by providing tools and functionalities that facilitates the development of any API-Centric App.

Apiato uses the best frameworks, tools and conventions in a very creative way, to deliver a rich set of features for a modern PHP Application.

Apiato gives you the core features of robust API's fully documented, for free; so you can focus on writing your business logic, thus deliver faster to your clients.

    <summary>Why API-Centric Apps?</summary>

    Today weâ€™re living in a digital era, where almost everything is connected to the Internet.
    
    Building cross-devices applications is becoming a must. And to do it, you need APIs (Application Programing Interfaces).
    
    Web developers are used to serve HTML pages directly from the Backend. However, this traditional method has many disadvantages nowadays.
    
    API's can serve anything and everything (Mobile Apps, Web Apps, Smart TVs, Smart Watches,...).
    As well as, it can be exposed to the world allowing developers to interact with your Application and help growing your business.
    
    API-Centric Apps allows Frontend (Web + Mobile) and Backend developers to work on their codes in parallel. 
    After the Frontend Apps are ready they get attached to the Backend (API-Centric) code to start functioning. 
    This leads to zero decoupling between the Frontend and the Backend code and also removes the dependencies. 
    The API documentation acts as the contract between both sides during the development life cycle of all the Apps.
